🚢 Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset to understand passenger characteristics and identify factors affecting survival.
The analysis follows a structured EDA workflow, inspired by a YouTube tutorial, and applies both theoretical understanding and hands-on implementation.
📂 Dataset Used

train.csv

test.csv

These datasets contain passenger information such as age, gender, class, fare, family details, and survival status.
